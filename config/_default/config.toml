Hi I am Tasha Pais! Nice to meet you ðŸ¤ 

I study <span style="color:orchid">Computer Science.</span>
I can also play the piano and run a pretty fast mile.

I grew up in Bangalore, Queens, Singapore, and New Jersey
and have lived at three <span style="color:pink">co-living houses</span> recently.

One of my biggest priorities is diving deep into new tech
and <span style="color:darkorange">building technical competence.</span>

Check out my <a href="https://medium.com/@tashapais">writing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tashapais">code</a>. Connect with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/TashaPais">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tasha-pais-9360281a7/">LinkedIn</a>.

I currently work as a <span style="color:DodgerBlue">freelance fullstack developer.</span>
Have a challenge? ðŸ‘‰ tashapais@gmail.com
